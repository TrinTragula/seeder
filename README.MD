This is a webapp based upon a library ([cubiomes](https://github.com/Cubitect/cubiomes))
written by cubitect in C and compiled in webassembly by me.
Go and give him love.

It's a React app taht uses a WASM build of cubiomes to run the code in your browser, so that you
can look up your seeds/find your perfect ones whitout installing or configuring anything.
